## 1. Thematic Overview

Indulgence is a game of balancing pleasure, consumption, and regret. Can you engage in sensible gratification or will you succumb to temptation?

## 2. Components & Setup

Indulgence is a free-form game that requires 1+ players, and any number of items, vices, or activities that grant relatively immediate gratification to the player. To set up the game, gather the player(s) in a circle with all relevant objects in the center. If playing with multiple people, begin with the youngest player and proceed counterclockwise.

## 3. Game Overview & Structure

Each turn of Indulgence begins with an indulgence phase and ends with a reflection phase. You gain points when experiencing comfort, enjoyment, or satisfaction, and lose points when experiencing contrition or remorse. There is a 2x points multiplier if there is a photo associated with the experience, and a 5x multiplier if it was posted to social media.

## 4. Sample Game Turns

### 4.1. Rapid turn

You are alone watching Instagram Reels and wrist deep in a bag of BBQ chips. You haven’t been hungry for the last 20 minutes but you keep crunching. Should you stop?

### 4.2. Solo turn

Begin your turn by reaching for the Marlboro Golds and lighter on the table. It’s been so long since you’ve had one (6 hours) and the euphoria of a light headrush soothes your craving. You smoke two more and unconsciously build a habit of it. You chew gum and wash your hands before going to see your Hinge date, as you remember an off-hand comment they made about a dislike of the smell during your earlier flirtations. You hide it from your mom and your health insurance, in order to avoid maternal disapproval and a higher monthly bill.  

End the turn by weighing the pleasure of a pint and a smoke against the concern of your parents. If you're younger than 28, do **not** consider any health risks during reflection as your youth adds 3 points to Brashness.

### 4.3. Group turn 

Begin your turn by falling in love with the player to your left. As the turn progresses, place increasingly large portions of your self-worth on how you believe they perceive you. They become everything to you. Ensure that you neglect other pillars of your life, notably friendships, fitness, and recreational solo-time. If you get concerned about imbalance in your life, dull the voices with weed and build a silent contempt about the relationship. Ignore how they treat you when they drink, because they love you and it feels good to be loved.  

End the turn by weighing the affection and reassurance you feel against the possibility that you are using the other player as a crutch for your anxiety and depression. On initial reflection, consider only the flaws of the other player. On second reflection, consider your own.

## 5. Game End & Scoring

The game never ends. Calculate your current score by subtracting your total regret points from your total pleasure points and pray that you’re in the green.
